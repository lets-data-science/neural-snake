MDN compat table did not render: UNVERIFIED there |
| d | WorldTUI drift fix DAgger-style | same URL | "a page from DAgger, where a model learns from the states it visits" | verified on the page; "on the model's own predicted states" is an interpretation |

## Files each backend loads, onnxruntime-web 1.31.1 (added 2026-10-30)
Evidence is in `node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist/`. Line numbers are from the readable builds, which have the same flags as the `.min.mjs` files bench.js imports. The minified files were checked with grep: `ort.webgpu.min.mjs` names only `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs`, and `ort.wasm.min.mjs` names only `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs`.

| Entry bench.js imports | Loads (.mjs) | Loads (.wasm) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ort.webgpu.min.mjs` (`['webgpu']`) | `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.mjs` | `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.asyncify.wasm` | `ort.webgpu.mjs:1576` (module name), `ort.webgpu.mjs:4299` (wasm URL); the jsep and jspi branches are `false` |
| `ort.wasm.min.mjs` (`['wasm']`) | `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs` | `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm` | `ort.wasm.mjs:1576`, `ort.wasm.mjs:3520`; the other three branches are `false` |

- **jsep files:** neither path loads `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.*` in 1.31.1. The Phase 0 vendoring was wrong; these were guessed from the package.json `exports` list, not from the bundle code.
- **JSPI:** a separate entry point, `onnxruntime-web/jspi` (`ort.jspi.*`, exports at package.json lines 117-120). It loads `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jspi.mjs` and `.wasm` (`ort.jspi.mjs:1576`, `:4299`). It is chosen only by importing that entry; `ort.webgpu` never switches to it. The JSPI build throws if `"Suspending" in WebAssembly` is false (`ort.jspi.mjs:1781`).
- **Vendored set:** `web/vendor/` now holds exactly these 6 files, 43,799,252 bytes in total. Before this fix it held a different 6 files (the two jsep files instead of the two asyncify ones), 44,566,278 bytes.
